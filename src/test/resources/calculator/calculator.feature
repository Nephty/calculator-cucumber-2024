Feature: Integer Arithmetic Expressions
  This feature provides a range of scenarios corresponding to the
  intended external behaviour of arithmetic expressions on integers.

  # You can start with a Background: that will be run before executing each scenario.

  Background:
    Given I initialise a calculator

  # Each scenario can be seen as a test that can be executed with JUnit,
  # provided that each of the steps (Given, When, And and Then) are
  # implemented in a Java mapping file (CalculatorSteps.Java)

    # This is an example of a scenario in which we provide a list of numbers as input.
  # (In fact, this is not entirely true, since what is given as input is a table of
  # strings. In this case, the table is of dimension 1 * 3 (1 line and three columns).
